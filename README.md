# Codeforces Recent Contest Problem Collector 🧠

A Python script to collect and filter **recent Codeforces contest problems** by division and index — perfect for effective, modern competitive programming practice.

---

## ❓ Why not just solve old Codeforces problems?

Older Codeforces problems often don't reflect the **current style** or **difficulty progression** seen in today's contests. If you're practicing with problems from years ago, you're likely building intuition that's no longer optimal for recent rated rounds.

## ❓ What does this script do?

This script helps you **collect problems from recent contests only**, filtered by:

- **Division**: Div. 1, Div. 2, Div. 3, or Div. 4  
- **Problem Index**: A, B, C, D, etc.  
- **Date Range**: Only contests from the **last 2 years**  
- **Contest Type**: Rated contests only (no unrated/testing rounds)

It then saves the problems into a **CSV file** with metadata like tags, rating, and direct links — ready for structured practice.

## ❓ Who is this for?

- 🧩 **Beginners** who want to get better faster by solving modern problems  
- 🔁 **Returning CP users** who want to adapt to new trends  
- 📊 **Serious coders** looking to organize practice based on real, recent contests
